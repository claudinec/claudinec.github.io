I am primarily employed as a web developer on the Founders and Survivors project. I have also tutored in medical humanities subjects in the Centre for Health and Society.

## UFT

I inherited the first version of the UFT's Drupal website and have managed it since 2010. I have developed the online course handbook and timetable, which are reviewed annually, and assist in ongoing content editing (and maintenance).

# Projects

## Founders and Survivors

Founders and Survivors: Australian Lifecourses in Historical Context is an ARC-funded project which follows the lives of Australian families from the convict transportation period to the First World War. 

I designed, developed and continue the Drupal front-end for this project, and provide technical support for volunteers and research collaborators. I also assist with integrating community-contributed data into a complex XML database.

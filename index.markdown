I build websites for small businesses and organisations, primarily using the Drupal content management system. I am also Lead Developer at [Moat Media](http://moatmedia.com.au/), where I am part of a web development team working on larger projects.

# Current Projects

## Victorian Centre for Biostatistics

_2012 to present_

<http://vicbiostat.org.au/>

I developed the website for this new research centre.

## United Faculty of Theology

_2010 to present_

I inherited the first version of the UFT's Drupal website and have managed it since 2010. I have developed the online course handbook and timetable, which are reviewed annually, and assist in ongoing content editing.

# Past Projects

## Founders and Survivors

_2008 to 2012_

<http://foundersandsurvivors.org/>

Founders and Survivors: Australian Lifecourses in Historical Context is an ARC-funded project which follows the lives of Australian families from the convict transportation period to the First World War.

I designed, developed and continue the Drupal front-end for this project, and provided technical support for volunteers and research collaborators. I also assisted with integrating community-contributed data into a complex XML database.

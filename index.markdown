title: Web Development
---

I am a web developer who has specialised in Drupal development since 2008. Before turning to web development professionally, I worked in the higher education and research sector, primarily in statistical data management and in public health and social science research. I am actively involved in the Drupal community in Melbourne, and encourage the use of free and open source software for web development.

# Current Projects

## United Faculty of Theology

_2010 to present_

<http://www.uft.edu.au/>

I inherited the first version of the UFT's Drupal website and have managed it
since 2010. I have developed the online course handbook and timetable, which
are reviewed annually, and assist in ongoing content editing.

# Recent Past Projects

## Founders and Survivors

_2008 to 2012_

<http://foundersandsurvivors.org/>

**Founders and Survivors: Australian Lifecourses in Historical Context** is an
ARC-funded project which follows the lives of Australian families from the
convict transportation period to the First World War.

I designed, developed and continue the Drupal front-end for this project, and
provided technical support for volunteers and research collaborators. I also
assisted with integrating community-contributed data into a complex XML
database.

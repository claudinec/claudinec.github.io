I also wrote [a few months ago](/content/where-have-i-been) about major developments in my theological 'side'. Since returning from the Edinburgh 2010 mission conference, I have written about it for *The Melbourne Anglican* (not online, sadly) and given three presentations in ecumenical and theological education settings. I have three more presentations lined up before the end of the year.

I am starting to think about a minor (12,000 word) thesis next  year with the Edinburgh 2010 conference as a starting point, analysing the different processes and forms of communication behind large global conferences. We spent a lot of time Debating Issues, but this conference also encouraged more informal and conversational interaction, both face-to-face and online. It's a sign that Twitter has become mainstream when a church conference adopts an official Twitter backchannel (a practice that has become common in technical conferences). I think there is some kind of theological analysis to be drawn out of this, but I'm not sure what it will look like yet.

And so, as I see the possibility of my geek self and theological self reaching some kind of convergence, I am trying to integrate my online presence again. My [Posterous](http://claudinec.net/) blog is still online; I found it easy to update quickly from multiple locations while travelling, and I don't want to lose the existing content. I'm hoping, though, that in the future I won't feel the need to keep theology and technology so far apart.

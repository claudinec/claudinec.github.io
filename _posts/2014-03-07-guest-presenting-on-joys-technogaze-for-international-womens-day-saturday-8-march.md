I'm making my radio debut tomorrow! [Technogaze](http://joy.org.au/technogaze/) is the technology program on JOY 94.9, Melbourne's GLBTIQ community radio station. For International Women's Day (noon tomorrow, Saturday 8 March), I will join the regular panel and talking about women in technology and whatever else might come up in the program.

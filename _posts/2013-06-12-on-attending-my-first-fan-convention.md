On the long weekend, I attended [Continuum](http://continuum.org.au/c9/), my first science fiction fan convention ever. It started off with me registering then sitting with NK Jemisin waiting for the Continuum 101 session to begin - I guessed that it might be her, but didn't want to assume (and, not having read any of her work, I didn't want to get into an awkward position).

I read a fair bit of fantasy and science fiction when I was a teenager, but felt ostracised for it and mostly gave it up for 'serious' literature when I went to university. I have been exposed to fandom through friends but only started reading and watching science fiction again a few years ago. I was afraid that conventions would be isolating in similar ways to technology conferences, especially as a woman from an ethnic minority who is also relatively new to fandom. I probably only felt confident about attending because I knew the chair and some of the committee members and expected them to bring some diversity to the programme.

I didn't need to have these fears, and Continuum has set a high standard for future conventions for me. There were many genuine efforts to welcome newcomers and lurkers. Nora Jemisin's [Guest of Honour speech](http://nkjemisin.com/2013/06/continuum-goh-speech/) confronted injustice in science fiction, and questions of injustice and inappropriate representation were raised in many panels. I estimate at least 50% of the members were women, which far exceeds the ratio at any tech event I have attended (apart from female-only ones). It felt like a safe environment for minority, queer, and disabled people (as far as I could tell from my mostly-able perspective). None of this surprises me, knowing the committee, but I suspect it's not representative of the wider world of fandom.

In 2014, Continuum will (again) be the Australian national convention. I expect I'll be there - I've got the convention bug now. That gives me a year to catch up on a lot of books and DVDs.

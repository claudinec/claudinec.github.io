The bottom of the front page of this site now displays books that I have listed as 'currently-reading' on my [Goodreads profile](http://www.goodreads.com/claudinec).[^1] I would like to display these in a compact format (e.g. Currently Reading: Title by Author) but haven't yet found a way to extract this from Goodreads, so for now I am displaying the default 'book review' display provided by the Goodreads API.

The code for this display is available as a [Drupal module](https://github.com/claudinec/currently_reading) for use on other Drupal sites. With time, I'd like to expand this module to display reading lists from other services such as LibraryThing, and provide more configuration options if possible. Suggestions and patches are welcome.

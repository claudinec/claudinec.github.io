I [said](/content/where-have-i-been) that I would write more about the new incarnation of the Founders and Survivors website, but I have not had the time or mental space to reflect on the development process. So, for now, please just feast your eyes on the [new site](http://foundersandsurvivors.org/), which was developed with the help of Robin Petterd from [Sprout Labs](http://sproutlabs.com.au/) in Hobart.

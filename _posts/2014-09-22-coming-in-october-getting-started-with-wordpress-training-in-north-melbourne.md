I can help you build a website using Drupal or WordPress, two popular and robust content management systems. But what if you don’t have the budget to hire a developer, or want to learn to build websites yourself?
 
I am introducing personalised, one-on-one training, starting in October. For a fraction of the cost of professional web development, I will get you started with training tailored to your specific needs. This may be right for you if you only need a simple website or blog which doesn't require complex programming or data structures.

## Getting started with WordPress
 
Learn to build a website or blog with WordPress, one of the most popular blogging platforms available. My one-on-one WordPress training sessions are tailored to your needs, covering topic such as:

* Hosting options - wordpress.com or self-hosting
* Understanding Pages, Posts and other content types
* Choosing and installing themes
* Exploring plugins
* Updating and maintaining your website
* Getting help
 
Introductory rates for 2014 are $132 (incl. GST) for two hours.
 
Sessions for October can now be booked at https://claudinec.youcanbook.me/. If you're not sure if this is right for you, contact me first at http://claudinec.net/contact.

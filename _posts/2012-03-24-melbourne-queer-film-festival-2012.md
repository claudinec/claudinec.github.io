This year I saw six films at the [Melbourne Queer Film Festival](http://mqff.com.au/), a 100% increase on 2011 (my first year).

Films, from most favourite to least favourite:

1. [Wish Me Away](http://www.wishmeawaydoc.com/)
2. [The Cure](https://www.facebook.com/pages/The-Cure-Documentary/126971887327260)
3. [Codependent Lesbian Space Alien Seeks Same](http://www.codependentlesbianspacealienseekssame.com/new/)
4. [With Every Heartbeat (Kiss me)](http://yellowaffair.com/web/guest/product?redirect=%2Fweb%2Fguest&productId=5768115)
5. [Daphne](http://www.mqff.com.au/film.php?PID=37)
6. [Circumstance](http://www.marakeshfilms.com/)

Stats:

- 2 documentaries, 4 features
- 5 with lesbian themes, 1 general (with predominantly male subjects)
- 1 Australian, 2 USA, 1 Swedish, 1 English, 1 Iranian
- 4 with positive endings/resolutions, 2 with negative -- a big improvement on my selection last year

Favourite quotes (paraphrased), from The Cure:

> Don't heterosexual men admire the strength of a man's legs ... I mean, I'm heterosexual too.

and Wish Me Away:

> I'm so happy to say I'M GAYYYY!

The [Day in the Life of Digital Humanities 2010](http://tapor.ualberta.ca/taporwiki/index.php/Day_in_the_Life_of_the_Digital_Humanities_2010) is 18 March. This is a study day for me (when I'm *not* working on digital humanities projects) so I'm not participating. I'll watch this event with interest though, and maybe participate next year.

The obligatory Twitter hashtag is [**dayofdh**](http://search.twitter.com/search?q=%23dayofdh).

I'm happy to announce a new publication that I have been working on with fellow journalism students at the University of Melbourne.

[**Veer**](http://veer.buzz/) aims to publish new voices and perspectives from Melbourne's LGBTI community. You can read about our vision at http://veer.buzz/2014/09/welcome-to-veer/ and follow us on Twitter at [@veer_buzz](https://twitter.com/veer_buzz).

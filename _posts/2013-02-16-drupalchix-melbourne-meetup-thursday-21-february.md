The first Drupalchix/Women in Drupal Melbourne meetup for 2013 is on next Thursday, 21 February, at the [Electron Workshop](http://www.electronworkshop.com.au/) coworking space in North Melbourne. This group is a supplement to the wider [Melbourne Drupal](http://www.meetup.com/drupalmelbourne/) meetup group, and aims to provide a forum for women who use Drupal (or are even thinking of using Drupal) to network and learn from each other.

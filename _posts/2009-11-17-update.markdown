title: update and review of online presence
---

I haven't been blogging as much as I used to. I have been posting frequently on [identi.ca](http://identi.ca/claudine) and [Twitter](http://twitter.com/claudinec) (a public arena) and on Facebook (semi-public) but haven't been writing longer, detailed posts. I still write a lot, privately and for assessment, but I think the depth and quality of my *public* online presence has declined. It's not for want of ideas or interesting life changes, but micro-blogging and social networking seem to have swallowed up the time that I used to put into blogging. I don't think this is good, especially as I am now trying to develop a more visible professional identity online.

This latest attempt at an online 'home' uses [GitHub Pages](http://github.com/blog/272-github-pages). I use GitHub to host some of my code (both public and private) and watch other developers' projects -- it's 'a social network for geeks'. Their Pages system, using the [Jekyll](http://github.com/mojombo/jekyll/) site generator, requires some technical proficiency and means that I keep a copy of all my content, but it takes care of some of the routine details of generating a blog. GitHub and identi.ca are two of the fast-moving online communities of geeks now -- I [asked for help](http://identi.ca/notice/14888581) with adding an Atom feed to this site and [got a useful answer](http://identi.ca/notice/14888677) within minutes.

Herewith a brief update, for the benefit of the disparate groups of people who follow me online, and perhaps for my own memory. (And my next (non-significant) birthday is approaching scarily fast, so it seems a good time for taking stock.)

I'm still working at the Centre for Health and Society at the University of Melbourne, and these days spend most of my time on the [Founders and Survivors](http://www.foundersandsurvivors.org/) project. This is a huge, ambitious project to transcribe and digitise archival data on every convict who was transported to Van Diemen's Land, and link this with information on their descendants -- particularly those who served in the First World War -- to identify connections across generations in health, wellbeing and resilience. It involves collaborations between academics across a range of disciplines and genealogists and amateur historians. My role has largely been developing the public website in Drupal and finding ways to connect the data that volunteers submit on their convict ancestors with our archival data.

I am thinking more these days about the field of 'digital humanities' or 'humanities computing' ([even the name of the field is still in flux](http://www.arts-humanities.net/bibliography/574)). This is an active field in the USA, UK, and Europe, but in Australia there doesn't seem to be same level of awareness or activity. There *are* various projects based in Australia that apply emerging computer technology to problems in the humanities, but the professional networking and scholarly identity hasn't taken off yet. I sometimes have the feeling of being on a kind of frontier; it's exciting, and at the same time there is some anxiety about not knowing where this will lead me.

At the same time, I am continuing my studies in theology, and hope to complete an honours programme in systematic theology and church history over the next two years. (Yes, it's a master's degree with honours, yes, that *is* odd.) It's not enough to ride the digital humanities train -- having a contribution to make in terms of historical methodology; if I am to continue in academia, I need a field (time and place) to focus on, at least at this junior stage. I have some ideas in gestation in the area of 19th and 20th century Australian history and hope to identify a viable question for a minor thesis.

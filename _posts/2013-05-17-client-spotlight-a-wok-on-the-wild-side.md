One of my current web development clients is my mother, Ida Chionh, and I think it's been quite an educational process for both of us as we find ourselves in a client-freelancer relationship instead of (well, in addition to) a mother-daughter one.

Today Mum is launching her new website, **A Wok on the Wild Side**, an exploration of her passion for food, travel, and the arts. Both my parents have been dedicated home cooks for as long as I can remember, and Mum started reviewing restaurants in Melbourne in the early 1980s, when sweet and sour pork and butter chicken were still strange and exotic dishes. Mum has a lot of stories and knowledge to share about food and cooking, and I'm pleased to provide her with another platform for her to share her experiences.

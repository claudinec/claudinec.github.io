After just over a year as a freelance web developer, I have got a better sense of the questions that I should be asking prospective clients, in order to make the process easier for both myself and for clients. I have now built a <a href="/form/web-development-inquiry">web development inquiry form</a> which can help me see how far a prospective client is into the planning process, and how much thought they have put into the project.

If you would like a quote or discussion of my services, please use <a href="/form/web-development-inquiry">this form</a>. I would also welcome feedback from other developers on whether they have found a form like this helpful for their business, or whether there are any other questions I should be asking.

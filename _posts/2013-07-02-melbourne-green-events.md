[**Melbourne Green Events**](/mge) is a weekly email publicising events related to environmental sustainability, debate, and activism across Melbourne. It is published every Monday morning.

As an active member of the Greens who maintains a few websites and is active on social media, I often hear about or am asked to publicise such events. Melbourne Green Events will be a resource for green/environmental events and is **not** endorsed by or affiliated with any particular organisation.

I could be accused of duplicating the efforts of [The Victorian Climate Action Calendar](http://vcac.org.au/calendar/) or the [Sustainable Melbourne Calendar](http://www.sustainablemelbourne.com/category/events/). However neither looks very comprehensive, and VCAC doesn't appear to have been updated for a few months. I have received some encouragement to go ahead with this, which suggests that my friends and followers on social media are mostly unaware of these other resources.

Melbourne Green Events is a personal initiative of mine and is not endorsed by any party or organisation.

This month: Brainstorming events and activities for this group in the second half of 2013. What do **you** want to get out of Drupalchix?

Site builders, themers, content editors, project managers, community builders, plain old interested parties, whatever your role may be you are all welcome. We have an ambitious goal to find all the hidden women of Drupal to help build and strengthen the wider Melbourne Drupal community, as well as provide a forum for women to network and learn about Drupal.

Thanks to the [Electron Workshop](http://www.electronworkshop.com.au/) for hosting us again - 31 Arden St, North Melbourne.

[Please RSVP on Meetup](http://www.meetup.com/Melbourne-Drupalchix/events/110853412/) to assist with planning and catering. Drinks and nibbles provided.

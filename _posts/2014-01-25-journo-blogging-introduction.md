In a few weeks I will begin a [Master of Journalism at the University of Melbourne](/story/studying-journalism). One of my challenges in moving into journalism will be learning to write quickly, often, and to a deadline. I've also had this personal website that has evolved over about a decade, reflecting the changes in my life and work over that time. In preparation for this next change, I am going to start a new blog series (which I'm calling ‘Journo-blogging’ until/unless I find a better name) to get back into the habit of regular writing in public, and to open up conversations about the changing nature of journalism.

I have a few ideas in mind, or at least general themes, which come from my perspective as a web professional who has always wanted to write. It will be an interesting time, establishing my own professional identity while the journalistic profession interrogates itself about its own direction and its relationship with wider society. One of the prompts for starting this series was reflecting on the blog [that a friend of mine created](http://teacherintherye.wordpress.com/) when he started a Master of Teaching last year. Before that, there were private conversations on how much a teacher or student-teacher could safely disclose online about himself or or his work. For journalists, there seems to me to be a more enthusiastic push towards blogging and online self-exposure, which can lead to blurred distinctions between public and private lives, and professional and personal opinions.

At this stage my intention is to write one post a week, some time between Friday and Sunday (my first semester classes are on Thursday afternoons). It may be related to the curriculum or about journalism and media more generally. Let's see how long this experiment lasts.

title: Wellington, New Zealand -- first impressions
---

It's wet and windy here. Wellington in January is like Melbourne in August. Even [locals are complaining](http://www.stuff.co.nz/national/3234694/Bad-weather-good-business-for-some) now. Still, I would take a wet, windy summer over 40&deg; heat, any day. Wellington is compact and the population is small, but it still feels like a vibrant, active city. A vibrant, active city that I can mostly cover on foot. I think I could get used to this.

This is my first visit to New Zealand, after 26 years living in the big country next door. I never got round to crossing the Tasman because 'New Zealand is just there and it's not about to go away' (just like Uluru and other Australian landmarks that I haven't seen). It's about time I made the effort.

I visited the [Museum of New Zealand, _Te Papa Tongarewa_](http://www.tepapa.govt.nz/) today, and choked up a bit at the [exhibit](http://www.tepapa.govt.nz/WhatsOn/exhibitions/Pages/SignsofaNation.aspx) on the [Treaty of Waitangi](http://www.waitangi-tribunal.govt.nz/treaty/). The context and the history are different, but I feel angry and ashamed that a treaty like this is still impossible in Australia.

My [LCA2010 presentation](http://www.lca2010.org.nz/programme/schedule/view_talk/50163?day=wednesday) is nearly ready -- I just need another dry run or two. I have even started building a [schedule](http://claudine.github.com/lca2010/) of other presentations to catch, which will probably be revised frequently over the course of the week. My [DrupalSouth presentation](http://wellington2010.drupalsouth.net.nz/session/using-drupal-for-collaborative-historical-research) is at a more embryonic stage.

I have a [photo album on Picasa](http://picasaweb.google.com/claudinec/Wellington2010) -- I'm using Picasa largely to manage photos on this laptop, as I can't update iPhoto on this machine. (I know, I should be using Linux, but I'm not.) Conference photos might reappear later on Flickr or elsewhere.

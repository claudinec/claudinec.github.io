I went to a [mission conference](http://www.edinburgh2010.org/) in Edinburgh, followed by a bit of sightseeing in London, then a few days of meetings and workshops in Hobart for the Founders and Survivors project.

We are developing the next stage of the Founders and Survivors website, which in my view has always been in 'beta' or 'preview' stage -- but that's not the language we've used in the project. We have engaged Robin Petterd ([Sprout Labs](http://sproutlabs.com.au/)) to work on interface design. He also has a lot of experience and interest in educational technology and digital humanities. I have found it invaluable to work with another web developer, not just to help fill the gaps in my own skills, but to have someone else on the team who 'gets' digital humanities and has a creative approach to using emerging technology in education and research. I will post more about the new site and the design process when it is ready to launch.

As my first sentence might suggest, there have been some major developments in my other professional life outside of my paid work. In fact, for the first time I can seriously think of theological study and church leadership as a real (not potential) part of my professional identity. For the time being I am keeping two blogs, this one for digital humanities, Drupal and other technical topics, and [another](http://claudinec.net/) for everything else. I would like to see these different areas better integrated in my real life, but I don't think I'm ready for that yet.

Some thoughts:

Mashup of LCA2010 and DrupalSouth talks

What I did on my holidays: NZ/LCA/Drupal

Learning about Drupal modules

Unlocking the ivory tower; we are all historians

History: boring --> relevant

Digitisation, analysis, collaboration

'Libraries' and 'museums' (not such a huge difference between literary and historical archives?)

FAS: paper databases

Drupal (yay for tw/migrate)

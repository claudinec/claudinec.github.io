I'm thinking of offering low-cost web hosting and online media training for activist and community groups. I'm concerned about the increasing commercialisation of the online commons, and about small groups becoming dependent on ‘free’ services offered by corporations that do not share their values. I want to help empower people to reclaim the DIY ethic of the early days of the internet.

Interested or have similar ideas? [Let's chat.](/contact)

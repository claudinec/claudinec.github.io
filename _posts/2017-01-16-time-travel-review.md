title: Review of The Art of Time Travel by Tom Griffiths
---

This was an encouraging preparation for my (anticipated) return to studying history in 2017. Griffiths surveys the history of how Australians write and tell the history of this land, not just in the work of professional historians but also in fiction, poetry and archaeology. Woven through the scholarly narrative are Griffiths' recollections of his own training in the Melbourne and ANU history schools. His commitment to the twentieth-century French study of the _longue dur√©e_, histories spanning centuries, leads him to argue for a long view of Australian history from the Pleistocene era to "the unfolding present" of human-inflicted climate change.

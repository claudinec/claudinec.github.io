I seem to re-evaluate my online presence every few months, especially in terms of my home page and/or blog. I've been learning and using Drupal a lot at work over the last year, so it's about time I managed my personal site with Drupal as well.

One fewer car ... because I don't drive, and because 'one less car' upsets my grammatically conservative self.

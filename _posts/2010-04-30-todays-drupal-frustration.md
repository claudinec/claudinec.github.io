I have the [Simplenews](http://dgo.to/simplenews) and [Token](http://dgo.to/token) modules installed. I create a newsletter issue which includes links to other pages on the same site. I use the `[site-url]` prefix in these links. When I save the issue and send a test message to myself, `[site-url]` is expanded to the correct prefix for my domain. Then when I send the issue to all 600 subscribers, `[site-url]` is expanded to "localhost". How embarrassing! Where do I begin to try to track down this error?

PS Short links above are using the cool new Drupal.org URL shortener http://dgo.to/

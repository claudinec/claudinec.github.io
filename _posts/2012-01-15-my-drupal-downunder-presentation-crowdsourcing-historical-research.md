This afternoon I presented a case study of the Founders and Survivors project, 'Crowdsourcing Historical Research', at Drupal Downunder. My slides are available [live on Slideshare](http://www.slideshare.net/claudinec/crowdsourcing-historical-research) or as a [PDF download](http://drupaldownunder.org/session/crowdsourcing-historical-research).

The turnout was small, as historical applications are still a niche interest for geek conferences, but the people who did attend were interested in the topic and had great questions and suggestions about our use of Drupal, and about historical computing in general.

I think I am becoming a more confident speaker. I haven't spoken at a conference for 18 months, and not at a technical one since LCA and DrupalSouth 2010, but I wasn't as nervous as I thought I might be. My timing was pretty accurate without having to be rehearsed in detail, and I left enough time for a good discussion. I also got some encouraging and positive feedback about my speaking technique afterwards!

I am in the final stages of writing a 12,000 word thesis (in ecclesiology, in case that interests you) and one method of procrastination has been to write a little about some of the software that is helping me keep going.

[**OmmWriter Mac app.**](http://www.ommwriter.com/) This is one of the many apps that seek to remove the distractions that are so much a part of modern computer desktop environments. This app takes over the whole screen, turns off notifications from other programs, and plays some non-intrusive background music (I use earphones to minimise external noise). At this stage in the writing process, I have all of my sections planned, with various stages of drafting, from almost-complete drafts to bare outlines. However, when I am _writing_, I write everything in one single text file, with notes to myself to indicate where the small snippets I write belong. Afterwards, during dedicated editing time, I will incorporate these into the master document in [Scrivener](http://www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php) (that's a whole other post).

[**Nag iPhone app.**](http://electricpocket.com/nag/) This is simply a timer with various buttons for preset alarms. Twenty minutes for a writing dash, five minutes for a break. I've become so much more focused and productive knowing that I have fixed periods for writing and for resting (or browsing the web, or writing blog posts, or ...)

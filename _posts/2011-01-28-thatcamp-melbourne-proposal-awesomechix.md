A proposal for [THATCamp Melbourne](http://www.thatcampmelbourne.org/), inspired and encouraged by [kattekrab](http://kattekrab.net/) and [Kathy Reid](http://blog.kathyreid.id.au/). Ideas and suggestions welcome!

> AwesomeChix is the working title of a project to document achievements of Australian women in traditionally male-dominated fields. A few women involved in Australian LinuxChix have begun compiling a list [1], drawn primarily from science, technology, and politics. I would like to explore ways for the project to grow: technically, e.g. by implementing this in Drupal; and in scope, by inviting more submissions of women from non-technical fields. At THATCamp Melbourne, we could start a discussion of how we could implement and promote this project, and perhaps begin building a website for the project.

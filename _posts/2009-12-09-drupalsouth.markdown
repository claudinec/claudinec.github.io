title: DrupalSouth, Wellington, 23-24 January 2010
---

Following [LCA2010](http://claudine.github.com/lca2010/), I'm staying in Wellington for a couple of days for DrupalSouth. I'm planning to speak on the use of Drupal in the [Founders and Survivors](http://www.foundersandsurvivors.org/) project, as a kind of appendix to my [LCA presentation](http://www.lca2010.org.nz/programme/schedule/view_talk/50163?day=wednesday).

The press release follows. NZ$67.50 is bananas for Australians!

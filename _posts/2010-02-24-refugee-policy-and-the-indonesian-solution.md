I went to this [public lecture](http://www.law.monash.edu.au/castancentre/events/2010/taylor-lecture.html) nearly two weeks ago but haven't got round to writing about it yet, a sad comment on my priorities these days. Here are some brief notes before it's all forgotten.

**Out to Sea: Refugee Policy Under Rudd Government**

Jessie Taylor: Lawyer who visited Indonesia last July, detention centres and prisons, inhumane conditions.

Report: Behind Australian Doors. <http://behindaustraliandoors.wordpress.com/>

Film: Between the devil and the deep blue sea: A 52 minute documentary looking at the circumstances and decisions that lead someone to become a 'boat person'. <http://deepblueseafilm.wordpress.com/> (with trailer video)

'The Indonesian Solution': Australia pays the International Organisation for Migration (IOM) millions of $ to detain and 'process' asylum seekers (inc. Hazara from Afghanistan, Middle East...) in Indonesia.

Indonesia is not a signatory to the Refugee Convention (nearest signatory is Cambodia?) --> no obligations, standards, BUT their signing the convention may sweep issue under carpet.

IOM encouragement of 'voluntary' resettlement --> refoulement?

No accountability from IOM.

Processing of 'queue': 2-4 years, Australia accepts avg 52/year from Indonesia, 2100 in 'queue', wait 40 years.

UNHCR not processing anyone who arrived in Indonesia after 2007 (under Australian instruction?).

Need for real leadership from Australian government on this issue -- Rudd will be re-elected (???) so can take a risk and show some bravery.

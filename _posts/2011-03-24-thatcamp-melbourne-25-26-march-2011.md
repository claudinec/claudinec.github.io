Tomorrow and Saturday I will be at the first [THATCamp Melbourne](http://www.thatcampmelbourne.org/). [THATCamp](http://thatcamp.org/) -- The Humanities and Technology Camp -- is a kind of BarCamp or unconference focused on the intersection of humanities and computing/technology.

I haven't been to a THATCamp, BarCamp or unconference of any kind. Some of the published [session proposals](http://www.thatcampmelbourne.org/session-proposals/) look more detailed than I would have expected for an event like this, but perhaps that's because the THATCamp tends to draw more academics than other kinds of unconference.

I will probably go ahead with my proposal for [AwesomeChix](/content/thatcamp-melbourne-proposal-awesomechix) or something similar. It may not be as theoretical or data-driven as some of the other proposals, but my interest in the digital humanities has always been focused on the public, collaborative space, on using technology to enable more people outside the academy to contribute to conversations about history and society.

Watch the hashtag #thatcamp for more.

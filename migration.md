Notes on migration.

I'm not committed to Jekyll, I'm not familiar with Ruby, and I may want to move my website off Github now that it's owned by Microsoft.

I *do* want to keep using a static website generator that takes Markdown input files. I want to be able to host it anywhere and deploy using git or rsync.

Built in Perl:

* [ikiwiki](http://ikiwiki.info/)
* [dapper](http://markbenson.io/dapper/)

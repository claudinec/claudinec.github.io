I provide digital strategy and web development consulting services and have over five years' experience in Drupal development. I can also advise you on using WordPress for simple websites and blogs, or NationBuilder for political or activist campaigns.

My focus is on building sustainable websites for individuals and small companies and organisations. I am especially interested in working with organisations and projects that build local community and promote environmental sustainability.

## Services for charities, campaigners and activists

I provide NationBuilder advice, training and support to organisations working for an environmentally sustainable and equitable Australia.

NationBuilder is a software-as-a-service solution that helps grassroots community and political organisations coordinate in-person and digital campaigns. NationBuilder has been an instrumental part of successful election campaigns and community movements around the world.

I can help your organisation with:

- Deciding whether NationBuilder is right for you
- Advice on how to use NationBuilder in the context of your wider campaign strategy
- Setting up a public website, customising themes and managing domain settings
- Setting up email broadcast accounts and Facebook and Twitter integration
- Importing data from other newsletter and CRM systems into NationBuilder

## Services for small businesses

Your business website can be a simple as a one-page online brochure with a contact form, or as complex as an integrated publishing platform, product catalogue and always-open store.

I can help you with:

- Managing your own domain name with multiple email addresses at your domain
- Developing and hosting a website using WordPress or Drupal
- Developing an online store using e-commerce addons for WordPress or Drupal
- Integrating your website with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Pinterest
- Setting up email newsletters with MailChimp
- Setting up a customer relationship management (CRM) system and integrating it with your website, social media accounts and newsletters

## Services for creative individuals

A personal website enables you to share your creative vision with your audience on your own terms. You can provide samples of your work on an online portfolio, share your creative process on a blog, and advertise upcoming exhibitions or gigs.

I can help you with:

- Managing your own domain name with an email address at your domain
- Developing and hosting a website using WordPress or Drupal
- Integrating your website with Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and Pinterest
- Setting up email newsletters with MailChimp
